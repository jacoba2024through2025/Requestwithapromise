# Module 3 Request a Promise

There is a test suite to guide you and help you check yourself. To run the test suite, just view `SpecRunner.html` in your browser. I suggest using live server so that your tests rerun when you save you file.

**Important:** The test cases specify the name of the required methods, arguments, etc. So **read each test case carefully.** Test cases are located in the spec folder.

# Exercises
All functions should be defined in main.js located in the src folder. **This is the only file you should edit.**

Task:

Your job is to create a function called 'addNumbers' that takes two parameters, and returns a Promise. Your Promise should resolve with the sum of the two numbers. However, your Promise should reject with the message 'Invalid inputs must be numbers' if a none number is passed through.

**All test cases must pass**
<p>Hint: Use your console to help you debug.</p>
